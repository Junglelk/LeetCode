/**
 * Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].
 * <p>
 * Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.
 * <p>
 * 给你一个整数数组 nums ，数组中共有 n 个整数。132 模式的子序列 由三个整数 nums[i]、nums[j] 和 nums[k] 组成，并同时满足：i < j < k 和 nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] 。
 * <p>
 * 如果 nums 中存在 132 模式的子序列 ，返回 true ；否则，返回 false 。
